Description
üìä Evaluation Metrics: mAP\@50 and mAP\@50-95
üîπ mAP\@50-95
mAP\@50-95 means the mean Average Precision averaged over 10 IoU thresholds, from 0.50 to 0.95, with a step of 0.05.
That is: AP is calculated at IoU = 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, ‚Ä¶, 0.95, and the final score is the average of these 10 APs.
üîπ mAP\@50
mAP\@50 means mean Average Precision at IoU = 0.50.
* It is a lenient metric: the predicted bounding box is considered correct if the IoU ‚â• 0.50.

[ADD IN THE FOLLOWING, IN ADDITION TO THE CHOSEN SECTION ABOVE, IF SPECIFIC LICENSE IS CHECKED: The Competition Data is also subject to the following terms and conditions: [INSERT URL].
b. Data Security.
You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.
5. WINNER LICENSE [INSERT ONLY THE RELEVANT LICENSE LANGUAGE FOR THE COMPETITION.]
a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:
[Non-Exclusive: You hereby grant and will grant to Competition Sponsor and its designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale and import your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission, in any media now known or developed in the future, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without further approval by or payment to you.]
[*Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.
For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.
In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).
b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor‚Äôs specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner‚Äôs Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.
6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (‚ÄúExternal Data‚Äù) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).
b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., ‚Äúgeo restrictions‚Äù) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be ‚Äúreasonably accessible to all‚Äù and of ‚Äúminimal cost‚Äù. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):
Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a ‚ÄúReasonableness‚Äù standard (the ‚ÄúReasonableness Standard‚Äù). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.
By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.
c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (‚ÄúAMLT‚Äù)
Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (‚ÄúAMLT‚Äù) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
7. ELIGIBILITY
a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.
8. WINNER‚ÄôS OBLIGATIONS
a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:
Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines][5], must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment.
a. To the extent that the final model‚Äôs software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner‚Äôs Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).‚Äù
b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner‚Äôs Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,
Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;
Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).
9. GOVERNING LAW
a. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any provision of these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions of the Rules will remain in full force and effect.
Kaggle Competition Foundational Rules
(Non-editable)
Competition participants must also agree to Kaggle‚Äôs Foundational Competition Rules. These rules will supersede the competition-specific rules in the event of any conflict.
The following Kaggle Competition Foundational Rules (‚Äú Foundational Rules ‚Äù) apply to every competition regardless of whether the Sponsor creates competition-specific rules. Any competition-specific rules provided by the Sponsor are in addition to these rules, and in the case of any conflict or inconsistency, these Foundational Rules control and nullify contrary competition-specific rules.

I am participating in a datathon, so they give me a gpu enabled machine
(base) du@team2:~$                            (base) du@tea(b(bas((b(base) du@team2:~$ conda activate rmedu-mock                       
(rmedu-mock) du@team2:~$ 

this is the machine, 
so you will give me a ipynb file, where all the files will be sourced, I initially add the files in my local machine and then I will upload it to github, and then in the remote desktop i will clone that git repo and run the pipe line
